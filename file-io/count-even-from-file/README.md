# `count-even-from-file.py`

This script reads a file named `num-list.txt` containing comma-separated numbers and counts how many of them are even.

## How it works:
- Opens `num-list.txt` in read mode.
- Splits the contents using `,` to get individual numbers.
- Uses a `for` loop to check which numbers are even.
- Increments a counter and finally prints the result.
