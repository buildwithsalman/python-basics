`search-word.py`

This script checks if a specific word exists in a text file.

#  How it works:
- Reads the entire contents of `practice.txt`
- Searches for the word `"python"` in the text
- Prints `"found"` if the word exists, otherwise prints `"not found"`

#  Files:
- `search-word.py` → The main Python script
- `practice.txt` → A sample text file to search in

#  Concepts Used:
- File handling (`open()`, `read()`)
- String operations (`in` keyword)
- Conditional statements (`if-else`)
