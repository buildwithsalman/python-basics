`replace-word.py`

This script replaces all occurrences of a specific word in a file with a new word.

# How it works:
- Opens and reads `practice.txt`
- Replaces all `"java"` with `"python"`
- Writes the modified content back to the same file

# Concepts Used:
- File reading and writing (`r`, `w` modes)
- String method `.replace()`
