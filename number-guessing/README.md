# Guess the Number Game

A simple Python-based number guessing game where the computer randomly picks a number between 1 and 100, and you try to guess it in the fewest attempts possible!


## How It Works

- The computer picks a random number between **1 and 100**.
- You make guesses until you find the correct number.
- After each guess, the program tells you:
  - ðŸ”¼ **Too high**
  - ðŸ”½ **Too low**
  - âœ… **Correct!**
- It tracks the number of attempts you took.

## Concepts Used

- `while` loop  
- `if-elif-else` conditions  
- `input()` and `int()`  
- Random number generation using `random.randint()`  
- Basic variables and counters
