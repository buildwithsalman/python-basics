# Python Basics

A collection of beginner Python programs I'm creating to learn core programming concepts.  
Each folder contains a small, self-contained script and a short README explaining what it does.

## Project Structure

- [average](./average)  
  Calculate the average of two numbers entered by the user.

- [square](./square)  
  Compute the square of a number using Python's `**` operator.

- [compare-numbers](./compare-numbers)  
  Check if the first number is greater than the second and output `True` or `False`.

- [greatest-number](./greatest-number)  
  Takes three numbers as input from the user and prints which one is the greatest.

- [even-odd](./even-odd)  
  Reads an integer from the user and prints whether it is even or odd.

- [occurrence-cpunter](./occurrence-counter)  
  Counts how many times a given character or substring appears in the user-provided text.

- [multiplication-table](./multiplication-table)  
  Print the multiplication table of a user-provided number.

- [tuple-search](./tuple-search)  
  Search for a value inside a tuple using linear search and report its index.

- [factorial](./factorial)  
  Calculate the factorial of a given non-negative integer.

- [sum-upto](./sum-upto)  
  Calculate the sum of all integers from 0 up to a given number `n`.



## Goal

- Build *small projects* to strengthen my programming fundamentals.
- Learn *Git & GitHub workflow* for version control.
