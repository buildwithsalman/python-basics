# Python Basics

A collection of beginner Python programs I'm creating to learn core programming concepts.  
Each folder contains a small, self-contained script and a short README explaining what it does.

## Project Structure

- [average](./average)  
  Calculate the average of three numbers entered by the user.

- [square](./square)  
  Compute the square of a number using Python's `**` operator.

- [compare-numbers](./compare-numbers)  
  Check if the first number is greater than the second and output `True` or `False`.

- [greatest-number](./greatest-number)  
  Takes three numbers as input from the user and prints which one is the greatest.

- [even-odd](./even-odd)  
  Reads an integer from the user and prints whether it is even or odd.

- [occurrence-counter](./occurrence-counter)  
  Counts how many times a given character or substring appears in the user-provided text.

- [multiplication-table](./multiplication-table)  
  Print the multiplication table of a user-provided number.

- [tuple-search](./tuple-search)  
  Search for a value inside a tuple using linear search and report its index.

- [factorial](./factorial)  
  Calculate the factorial of a given non-negative integer.

- [sum-upto](./sum-upto)  
  Calculate the sum of all integers from 0 up to a given number `n`.

- [function-recursion](./function-recursion)  
  Codes where I used functions and recursion.

- [file-io](./file-io)  
  File handling projects including reading numbers, counting even values, searching for words, and replacing words in text files.

- [basic-calculator](./basic-calculator)  
  A beginner-friendly Python program that performs basic arithmetic operations based on user input

- [password-strength](./password-strength/)  
  Python program that checks the strength of a password based on character types and length.

- [percentage-calculator](./percentage-calculator/)  
  program that takes marks of multiple subjects and calculates the overall percentage based on user input.

- [number-guessing](./number-guessing/)  
  number guessing game where the computer randomly picks a number between 1 and 100, and you try to guess it in the fewest attempts possible!

- [to-do](./to-do/)  
  Command Line Interface (CLI) program to manage daily tasks.
  You can add tasks, view them, mark them as done, delete them, and exit anytime.

- [oop-circle](./oop-circle)   
  Practice program for Object-Oriented Programming using a `Circle` class with methods to calculate area and perimeter.

- [oop-account](./oop-account)   
  Beginner OOP program simulating a bank account with debit, credit, and balance check methods.

- [oop-average-marks](./oop-average-marks)    
  Beginner OOP program that stores a student's marks and calculates their average score.


## Goal

- Build *small projects* to strengthen my programming fundamentals.
- Learn *Git & GitHub workflow* for version control.
