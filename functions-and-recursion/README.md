# functions-and-recursion

This folder contains small Python programs that demonstrate the use of **functions** and **recursion**, helping reinforce concepts like function calls, return values, and recursive logic.

---

## Project Structure

Each subfolder contains a self-contained Python script and README explaining what it does.

- [average-function](./average-function/)  
  Calculates the average of three numbers using a function.

- [even-odd-function](./even-odd-function/)  
  Determines if a number is even or odd using functions.

- [factorial-function](./factorial-function/)  
  Calculates factorial using an iterative function.

- [factorial-recursion](./factorial-recursion/)  
  Calculates factorial using recursion.

- [list-ele-recursion](./list-ele-recursion/)   
  Recursively prints elements of a list.

- [n-sum-recursion](./n-sum-recursion/)  
  Uses recursion to find the sum of the first _n_ natural numbers given by user.
  
- [print-list-function](./print-list-function/)  
  Prints all elements in a list using a function.

- [sum-function](./sum-function/)  
  Returns the sum of two numbers given by user using a function.
