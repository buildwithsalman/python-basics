# Occurrence Counter

A simple Python script that counts how many times a given character or substring appears in the user-provided text.

## Description
This script prompts the user to enter a string (text/data) and then asks for a character or substring to search for. It uses Python's built-in string method to count and display the number of occurrences.

## Features
- Counts occurrences of a single character or a sequence of characters (substring).
- Case-sensitive by default.
- Works with any user input string.
